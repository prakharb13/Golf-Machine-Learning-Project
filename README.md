# Golf-ML-Repo

This project is designed to try and predict golf points and ranks, for data between 2010 and 2018.
Different algorithms were tried like Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and combination of these algorithms with interaction features.
The best model is Gradient Boosting with Interaction features giving 77.34% R-Square and 223.38 RMSE on Test Dataset.
